- IVY (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a free educational resource created by students for the benefit of other students. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data when you use the IVY website (“Site”).
- Spoiler: we don’t collect anything. But here are the details anyway.
---
- **1. No Personal Data Collection**
  - We do not ask for, store, or process any of the following:
    -  Names
    -  Email addresses
    -  School or location
    -  User accounts or login information
    -  IP addresses
    -  Device or browser information
  - You can use the entire site anonymously.
  - We do employ anonymous viewer tracking of total site access.
    -  This is done via contacting a third party "counter" rest API upon a view to the site, it only increments a number and no other data is stored or transmitted.

---

- **2. No Cookies**
  - We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any form of local storage to monitor your behavior.
  - If you see cookies in your browser while visiting IVY, they are likely from embedded third-party services (e.g., fonts, scripts, GitHub Pages hosting). IVY does not control or access any of this data.

---

- **3. No Third-Party Analytics**

  - We do not use Google Analytics, Matomo, or any other analytics platform.
    
  - We do employ anonymous viewer tracking of total site access. 
    -  This is done via contacting a third party counter API upon a view to the site, it only increments a number and no other data is stored or transmitted.
   
  -  What you do on IVY stays on IVY. No personally identifying information will ever leave the site.

---

- **4. No User Submissions**

  - You cannot upload files, post comments, or submit any form of user-generated content. There is no input collection anywhere on the site.

---

- **5. GitHub Repository**

  - Our educational content is also available on our public GitHub repository: _[https://github.com/NagusameCS/IVY](https://github.com/NagusameCS/IVY)_. GitHub may log basic technical metadata such as visit timestamps and IP addresses according to their own privacy policy. IVY has no access to or control over that data.

---

- **6. External Links and Embeds**

  - Our site may include links to or content from third-party platforms (e.g., embedded code examples, videos, or educational tools). These platforms may collect information independently in accordance with their own privacy policies.
  
  - IVY is not responsible for the privacy practices of these external services.

---

- **7. No Advertising or Monetization**

  - IVY does not run ads, promote products, or monetize user visits in any way.

---

- **8. Updates to This Policy**
