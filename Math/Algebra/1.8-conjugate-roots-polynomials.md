# 1.8 Conjugate Roots of Real-Coefficient Polynomials

## Objectives
- Understand conjugate root theorem
- Apply to factorization

## 1. Theorem
- If polynomial with real coefficients has root a+ib (b≠0) ⇒ a-ib also root

## 2. Implications
- Quadratic factors from complex pairs
- Ensures real-coefficient factorization

## 3. Practice Prompts
1. Given one complex root, find minimal polynomial factor
2. Complete factorization using conjugate root
