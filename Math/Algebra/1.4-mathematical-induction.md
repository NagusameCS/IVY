# 1.4 Proof by Mathematical Induction

## Objectives
- Understand structure of induction proofs
- Apply to summations and divisibility

## 1. Structure
1. Statement P(n)
2. Base case: verify n = n_0
3. Inductive step: assume P(k) then show P(k+1)
4. Conclude true for all n ≥ n_0

## 2. Common Uses
- Sum formulas (e.g., Σ i = n(n+1)/2)
- Divisibility statements
- Inequalities
- Recurrence relations

## 3. Variants
- Strong induction
- Induction with multiple base cases

## 4. Pitfalls
- Assuming what you must prove
- Failing to connect P(k) to P(k+1)

## 5. Practice Prompts
1. Prove sum of first n squares formula.
2. Show 3^n - 1 divisible by 2 for n≥1.
3. Prove inequality via induction.
