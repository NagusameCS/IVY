# 1.3 Counting Principles and Binomial Theorem

## Objectives
- Apply fundamental counting principle
- Use permutations and combinations
- Expand (a+b)^n via binomial theorem

## 1. Counting Principles
- Multiplication rule: if independent stages m, n ⇒ m·n outcomes
- Addition rule (disjoint sets)

## 2. Factorial
- n! definition; 0! = 1

## 3. Permutations
- nPr = n!/(n-r)! (ordered selection)

## 4. Combinations
- nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!) (unordered selection)
- Symmetry: nCr = nC(n-r)

## 5. Binomial Theorem
- (a+b)^n = Σ_{k=0}^{n} (n choose k) a^{n-k} b^k
- Number of terms = n+1
- Middle term(s) for even/odd n

## 6. Applications
- Probability counting
- Coefficient extraction

## 7. Practice Prompts
1. Distinguish permutation vs combination.
2. Find specific binomial coefficient.
3. Find term containing given power.
4. Probability using counting methods.
