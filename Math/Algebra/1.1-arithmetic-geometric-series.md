# 1.1 Arithmetic & Geometric Sequences and Series

## Objectives
- Define arithmetic and geometric sequences
- Derive and apply formulas for nth term and sum (finite & infinite where applicable)
- Use sigma notation
- Model simple applications (finance, growth/decay, patterns)

## 1. Arithmetic Sequences
- Definition: constant difference d
- nth term: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
- Sum: S_n = n/2 (2a_1 + (n-1)d)

## 2. Geometric Sequences
- Definition: constant ratio r (r ≠ 0)
- nth term: a_n = a_1 r^{n-1}
- Finite sum (r ≠ 1): S_n = a_1 (1-r^n)/(1-r)
- Infinite sum (|r| < 1): S_∞ = a_1/(1-r)

## 3. Sigma (Σ) Notation
- Structure: Σ_{k=m}^{n} expression in k
- Common manipulations: linearity, splitting sums

## 4. Applications
- Simple interest vs repeated addition
- Compound interest model: A = P(1+r)^n (geometric)
- Depreciation, population models

## 5. Practice Prompts
1. Find 25th term given a_1 and d.
2. Sum first 50 terms of given arithmetic sequence.
3. Sum of infinite geometric series with |r|<1.
4. Express sequence with pattern as sigma.

## 6. Extension Ideas
- Mixed series recognition
- Recurrence relations
