# 2.5 Polynomial Functions

## Objectives
- Recognize polynomial graphs
- Apply factor & remainder theorems
- Understand fundamental theorem of algebra

## 1. Definitions
- Polynomial: Σ a_k x^k
- Degree: highest k with non-zero coefficient

## 2. Factor & Remainder Theorems
- If f(c)=0 ⇒ (x-c) factor
- f(x)=(x-c)q(x)+f(c)

## 3. Fundamental Theorem
- Degree n polynomial has n roots in ℂ (counting multiplicity)

## 4. Shape Features
- End behaviour by leading term
- Turning points ≤ n-1

## Practice Prompts
1. Factor using rational root test
2. Use remainder theorem quickly
3. Sketch with intercepts & end behaviour
