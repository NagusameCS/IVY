# 4.7 Intersections & Angles (Lines/Planes)

## Objectives
- Line-plane intersection
- Plane-plane intersection
- Triple plane intersection
- Angle line-plane, plane-plane

## 1. Line-Plane Intersection
- Substitute parametric line into plane equation

## 2. Plane-Plane Intersection
- Direction = n1 × n2

## 3. Triple Planes
- Solve system; check consistency

## 4. Angles
- Line-plane: use angle between line direction and plane normal (complement)
- Plane-plane: angle between normals

## Practice Prompts
1. Find intersection point
2. Angle between two planes
