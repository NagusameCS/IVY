# 4.6 Planes in 3D

## Objectives
- Vector form r = a + λ b + μ c
- Normal form r·n = a·n
- Cartesian equation ax+by+cz=d

## 1. Vector Form
- Two independent direction vectors b, c

## 2. Normal Vector
- n = b×c (if non-parallel)
- r·n = a·n defines plane

## 3. Cartesian
- From normal components (a,b,c)

## Practice Prompts
1. Find plane through three points
2. Convert between forms
