# 4.5 Vector (Cross) Product

## Objectives
- Define vector product
- Use properties and geometric meaning

## 1. Definition
- v × w perpendicular to both
- |v × w| = |v||w| sin θ
- Right-hand rule orientation

## 2. Component Formula
- Determinant form with i, j, k

## 3. Properties
- v×w = -w×v
- Distributive over addition
- (k v)×w = k(v×w)
- v×v = 0

## 4. Area Interpretation
- |v×w| = area of parallelogram

## Practice Prompts
1. Compute cross product
2. Determine area spanned
