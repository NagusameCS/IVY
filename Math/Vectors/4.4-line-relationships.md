# 4.4 Relationships Between Lines

## Objectives
- Classify lines: coincident, parallel, intersecting, skew
- Find intersection point if exists

## 1. Strategy
- Compare direction vectors
- Solve parametric system for intersection

## 2. Classification
- Parallel: direction vectors proportional
- Coincident: parallel + one point lies on other
- Intersecting: solution exists for parameters
- Skew: not parallel & no intersection

## Practice Prompts
1. Classify pair of lines
2. Find intersection or show none
