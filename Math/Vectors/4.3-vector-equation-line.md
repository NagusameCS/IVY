# 4.3 Vector Equation of a Line

## Objectives
- Write line as r = a + λ b
- Solve simple kinematics
- Angle between two lines

## 1. Form
- a: position vector of point
- b: direction vector

## 2. Parametric Components
- r = (x,y,z) = (a1 + λ b1, a2 + λ b2, a3 + λ b3)

## 3. Angle Between Lines
- Use angle between direction vectors

## Practice Prompts
1. Find point of line for given λ
2. Express line through two points
