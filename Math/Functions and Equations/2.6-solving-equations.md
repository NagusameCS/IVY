# 2.6 Solving Equations

## Objectives
- Solve quadratics analytically
- Use discriminant Δ=b^2-4ac
- Solve higher-degree polynomial equations (factor/graph/technology)
- Solve ax=b using logarithms

## 1. Quadratic Formula
- x = (-b ± √Δ)/(2a)
- Nature of roots via Δ

## 2. Polynomial Equations
- Factorization strategies
- Graph to approximate roots
- Technology when analytic methods fail

## 3. Exponential/Log Equations
- ax=b ⇒ x = log_a b

## Practice Prompts
1. Classify roots using discriminant
2. Solve quartic by factoring quadratics
3. Use technology to approximate non-factorable root
