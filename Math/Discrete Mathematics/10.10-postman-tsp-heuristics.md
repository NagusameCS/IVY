# 10.10 Chinese Postman & Travelling Salesman

## Objectives
- Chinese postman problem concept
- TSP heuristics: nearest-neighbour, deleted vertex bounds

## 1. Chinese Postman
- Shortest closed walk covering all edges

## 2. TSP
- Find minimum-weight Hamiltonian cycle (NP-hard)

## 3. Heuristics
- Nearest-neighbour for upper bound
- Deleted vertex (1-tree) lower bound

## Practice Prompts
1. Apply nearest-neighbour
2. Compute bound difference
