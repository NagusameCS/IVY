# 10.11 Recurrence Relations

## Objectives
- Define recurrence with initial conditions
- Solve first & second order linear homogeneous constant coefficient recurrences
- Solve u_n = a u_{n-1} + b
- Model scenarios

## 1. First Order Homogeneous
- u_n = r u_{n-1} â‡’ u_n = r^n u_0

## 2. Second Order
- u_n = A u_{n-1} + B u_{n-2}
- Characteristic equation r^2 - A r - B = 0

## 3. Non-Homogeneous Linear
- u_n = a u_{n-1} + b
- Particular solution u = b/(1-a) if |a|<1

## Practice Prompts
1. Solve second order recurrence
2. Find explicit formula for linear recurrence with constant term
