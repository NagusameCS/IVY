# 5.2 Basic Probability

## Objectives
- Define trial, outcome, sample space, event
- Compute simple probabilities
- Complementary events, diagrams

## 1. Probability
- P(A) = n(A)/n(U) (equally likely)
- Complement: P(A')=1-P(A)

## 2. Tools
- Venn diagrams
- Tree diagrams
- Tables of outcomes

## Practice Prompts
1. Simple probability from sample space
2. Complement event calculation
