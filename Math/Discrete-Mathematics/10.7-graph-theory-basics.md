# 10.7 Graph Theory Basics

## Objectives
- Graph concepts: vertices, edges, degree
- Types: simple, connected, complete, bipartite, planar, tree, weighted
- Subgraphs, complements
- Euler's relation & planarity bounds

## 1. Definitions
- Degree sequence, adjacency

## 2. Euler's Formula (planar connected)
- v - e + f = 2
- Bounds: e ≤ 3v - 6; bipartite planar: e ≤ 2v - 4

## Practice Prompts
1. Determine planarity
2. Identify graph type
