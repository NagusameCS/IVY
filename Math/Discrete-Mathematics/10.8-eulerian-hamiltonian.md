# 10.8 Walks, Trails, Paths & Cycles

## Objectives
- Distinguish walk, trail, path, circuit, cycle
- Eulerian trails/circuits
- Hamiltonian paths/cycles (intro)

## 1. Definitions
- Walk (repetition allowed), trail (no repeated edges), path (no repeated vertices)

## 2. Eulerian
- Trail exists if 0 or 2 odd degree vertices; circuit if all even degrees

## Practice Prompts
1. Classify as Eulerian
2. Find Eulerian trail
