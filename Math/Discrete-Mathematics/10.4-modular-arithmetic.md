# 10.4 Modular Arithmetic & Congruences

## Objectives
- Define congruence
- Solve linear congruences
- Chinese remainder theorem

## 1. Congruence
- a ≡ b (mod n) ⇔ n|(a-b)

## 2. Linear Congruence
- ax ≡ b (mod n) solvable if gcd(a,n)|b

## 3. Chinese Remainder
- System with pairwise coprime moduli has unique solution mod product

## Practice Prompts
1. Solve linear congruence
2. Solve system via CRT
