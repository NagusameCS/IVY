# 6.1 Limits, Continuity & Derivative Definition

## Objectives
- Informal ideas: limit, continuity, convergence
- Derivative from first principles
- Tangents, normals, rates, increasing/decreasing
- Second & higher derivatives

## 1. Limit Concept (Informal)
- lim_{x→a} f(x) = L

## 2. Continuity
- Continuous at a if limit equals f(a)

## 3. Derivative Definition
- f'(x)=lim_{h→0} [f(x+h)-f(x)]/h
- Gradient & instantaneous rate

## 4. Tangent & Normal
- Tangent slope f'(a); Normal slope -1/f'(a)

## 5. Monotonicity
- f'(x)>0 increasing; f'(x)<0 decreasing

## 6. Second Derivative
- f'' indicates concavity

## Practice Prompts
1. Derive derivative of x^2 from definition
2. Determine intervals of increase
