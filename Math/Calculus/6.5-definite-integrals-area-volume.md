# 6.5 Definite Integrals, Area & Volume

## Objectives
- Apply boundary condition to solve for constant
- Evaluate definite integrals
- Compute areas bounded by curves & axes
- Volumes of revolution about x- or y-axis

## 1. Definite Integral
- ∫_a^b f(x) dx = F(b)-F(a)

## 2. Area
- Between curve & x-axis: sign aware
- Between curves: ∫ (upper - lower)

## 3. Volumes of Revolution
- Around x-axis: V=π ∫_a^b [f(x)]^2 dx
- Around y-axis: V=π ∫ [x(y)]^2 dy

## Practice Prompts
1. Area between two functions
2. Volume of solid of revolution
