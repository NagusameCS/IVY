# 6.2 Differentiation Rules

## Objectives
- Differentiate basic functions
- Apply sum, constant multiple, product, quotient, chain rules
- Related rates, implicit differentiation
- Additional derivatives (sec, csc, cot, a^x, log_a x, inverse trig)

## 1. Basic Derivatives
- d/dx x^n = n x^{n-1}
- d/dx sin x = cos x; cos x = -sin x; tan x = sec^2 x
- d/dx e^x = e^x; ln x = 1/x

## 2. Rules
- (f+g)'=f'+g'
- (k f)'=k f'
- (fg)'=f'g+fg'
- (f/g)'=(f'g - fg')/g^2
- Chain: (f(g(x)))' = f'(g(x)) g'(x)

## 3. Implicit Differentiation
- Treat y as function of x; differentiate both sides

## 4. Related Rates
- Connect derivatives via chain rule with time

## 5. Additional Derivatives
- sec x = sec x tan x
- csc x = -csc x cot x
- cot x = -csc^2 x
- a^x = a^x ln a
- log_a x = 1/(x ln a)
- arcsin x = 1/√(1-x^2)
- arccos x = -1/√(1-x^2)
- arctan x = 1/(1+x^2)
